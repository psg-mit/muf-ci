# OOPSLA 2021 Artifact

This artifact is being submitted to support the paper "Statically Bounded-Memory Delayed Sampling for Probabilistic Streams".

This artifact contains:

- `README.md` this document,
- `muf-oopsla2021.ova` a virtual machine containing source code, pre-built binaries, and tests,
- The source code of the compiler and runtime (`/src`) and the tests (`/tests`).

### Claims Supported by Artifact

The artifact supports all claims in the Evaluation section of the paper.
In particular, executing the analysis on the benchmark programs produces the results in Table 1 of the paper indicating whether each program satisfies the m-consumed and unseparated paths properties.
The implementation of the type system presented in the paper is available in the file `src/compiler/analysis.ml`.
In addition, all the examples can be compiled and run with delayed sampling.


## Getting Started

First, import `muf-oopsla2021.ova` into your virtualization software. In our testing, we used [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) 6.1.22 on macOS Big Sur. This VM is packaged in the Open Virtual Appliance format and can be imported into VirtualBox through `File -> Import Appliance`. The VM contains an installation of Debian Linux and has no particular hardware or network requirements.

Once the VM boots, it should present a shell as the root user with no password necessary (the root password is `root` in case it is ever required).

The artifact is in the `oopsla2021-artifact` directory.
The `mufc` compiler is already installed.

```
$ cd oopsla2021-artifact
$ mufc --help
The muF Compiler. Options are:
  --only-check        Only run the static analysis (default false)
  --simulate <node>   Simulates the node <node> and generates a file <node>.ml (default main)
  --up-bound <int>    iteration bound for the unseparated paths analysis (default 10)
  -help               Display this list of options
  --help              Display this list of options
```

The `tests` directory contains a set of `.muf` programs corresponding to the benchmarks in the paper. You may execute the compiler on each program by supplying it as an argument, for example:

```shell
$ cd tests
$ mufc outlier.muf
```
Which

1. Displays the results of the static analysis,
2. Compiles the muF program to OCaml (`outlier.ml`)
3. Generates a simple simulation OCaml program (`main.ml`)
4. Builds an executable that runs the program (`outlier_main.exe`)

```shell
$ mufc outlier.muf
-- Analyzing outlier.muf
     x m-consumed analysis failure
     o Unseparated paths analysis success
-- Generating outlier.ml
-- Generating main.ml
ocamlfind ocamlc -linkpkg -package muf outlier.ml main.ml -o outlier_main.exe
```

You can now execute the program:

```shell
$ ./outlier_main.exe
gaussian (0.990099, 0.990099)
gaussian (0.996689, 0.665563)
gaussian (0.998758, 0.624845)
...
```

Note that stream processors never stop. Use `^C` to stop the execution.

You can also run `make tests` from the root of the project to compile all the examples.

The option `--only-check` only runs the analysis (without compilation).
Run `make bench` to run the analysis on all the benchmarks presented in the paper (see the "Relationship with the paper" section below).

## Relationship with the paper

### Section 2

The muF program of Figure 1 is available in `tests/robot.muf`.
The stream function `controller` uses a `lqr` function that acts as a place-holder for a linearâ€“quadratic regulator.
The analysis does not depend on the implementation of `lqr`, but the implementation requires matrix operations that are not yet supported.

### Section 4

Compared to the syntax given in the paper, in the examples, our implementation requires the programmer to explicitly build symbolic term (`'a expr`) values as described in Section 4.1 using special constructs with the following API:


```ocaml
val const : 'a -> 'a expr
val add : float expr * float expr -> float expr
val mult : float expr * float expr -> float expr
val app : ('a -> 'b) expr * 'a expr -> 'b expr
val pair : 'a expr * 'b expr -> ('a * 'b) expr
val array : 'a expr array -> 'a array expr
val lst : 'a expr list -> 'a list expr
val ite : bool expr -> 'a expr -> 'a expr -> 'a expr

val eval : 'a expr -> 'a

val sample : 'a distribution -> 'a expr
val observe : 'a distribution * 'a -> unit
```

Concrete values can be obtained from symbolic values with the `eval` function (e.g., for the condition of a `if` statement), and `sample` always returns a `'a expr`.

To perform symbolic computations, the delayed sampling runtime requires some distribution parameters to be of type `'a expr` :

```ocaml
val gaussian : float expr * float -> float ds_distribution
val beta : float * float -> float ds_distribution
val bernoulli : float expr -> bool ds_distribution
```

Examples:

- `x = sample (bernoulli (0.5))` should be written `x = sample (bernoulli (const (0.5))` (see coin_outlier.muf).

- `x = sample (gaussian (0., 1.))` should be written `x = sample (gaussian (const (0.), 1.)` (see gaussian_gaussian.muf). Note that the `gaussian` construct uses a symbolic value for the mean but a concrete value for the variance.

- If `x = sample ...` then `if x then ...` should be written `if eval (x) then ...` (see `coin_outlier.muf`).

The muF compiler is a prototype focusing on the static analysis presented in the paper.
These discrepancies could be addressed with a simple compilation pass that we leave for future work.

### Section 7

To test the benchmarks presented in Table 1, run the analysis on the following files, or simply run `make bench`.

| Paper Benchmark      | Filename                |  m-consumed | Unseparated paths |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Kalman               | `kalman_normal.muf`     | o           | o                 |
| Kalman Hold-First    | `kalman_first.muf`      | o           | x                 |
| Gaussian Random Walk | `kalman_generative.muf` | x           | o                 |
| Robot                | `robot.muf`             | o           | o                 |
| Coin                 | `coin.muf`              | o           | o                 |
| Gaussian-Gaussian    | `gaussian_gaussian.muf` | o           | o                 |
| Outlier              | `outlier.muf`           | x           | o                 |
| MTT                  | `mtt.muf`               | x           | o                 |
| SLAM                 | `slam_array.muf`        | x           | o                 |

The remaining examples in the `tests/` directory are valid programs but are not described in the paper.

For each example, the compiler returns the outcome of two analyses: m-consumed and unseparated paths analysis.
For this experiment, the `--only-check` option is set to true. The compiler will not try to generate an executable.
To execute an example, you need to first compile it, e.g.,:

```
$ mufc kalman_normal.muf
$ ./kalman_normal_main.exe
```

## Step by Step Instructions

### Installation

The muF runtime depends on [ProbZelus](https://github.com/ibm/probzelus).
Once ProbZelus is installed, in the toplevel directory (containing the files `Makefile` and `muf.opam`), type `make init` to install the artifact from scratch.

You should now have the `mufc` compiler in your path.
Run the following command to test your installation:
```
$ mufc --help
```

### Writing muF programs

The best way to write a new muF test program is to follow the syntax of the examples. Every muF program is a series of  `fun` (regular function) and `stream` (stream function) declarations. For example, in `tests/robot.muf`, there are four `stream` declarations: `kalman`, `controller`, `robot`, and `main`; and one `fun` declaration: `lqr`.

Every stream declaration is of the form

```text
val <stream-name> = stream {
    init = <init-val>;
    step (<state-pat>, <arg-pat>) =
        <step-exp>
}
```

where `stream-name` is the identifier for the stream, `init-val` is the initial value of the stream, and `step-exp` is the expression evaluated at every iteration. `state-pat` is a pattern that binds the input state of the step function, and `arg-pat` is a pattern that binds the argument being supplied to the stream. Note that `init-val` must be a syntactic value (such as a numeric literal) or the instantiation of a stream function (`init` or `infer`) and that `state-pat` should be compatible with the type of the initial value.

The step function accepts the current state and a supplied argument to compute a pair of (new state, output value). Inside the step function, the following core constructs can be used:

- `sample`, which accepts a distribution and yields a sample from that distribution
- `observe`, which accepts a (distribution, value) pair and observes that distribution to be that value.
- `unfold`, which accepts a (stream, value) pair and yields a pair (output, new stream).

If the step function uses `sample` or `observe` it is considered a probabilistic stream.

Furthermore, these core constructs may also be used inside the initial value:

- `init`, which accepts the name of a stream declaration and creates an instance of that non-probabilistic stream.
- `infer`, which accepts a (number of particles, name of stream declaration) pair and creates an instance of that probabilistic stream.

There are a number of built-in distributions and operators such as `gaussian`. Please examine the supplied programs to see examples of these built-in operators.

Finally, as mentioned in Section _"Relationship with the paper, Section 4"_, our implementation requires the programmer to explicitly build symbolic term (`'a expr`) values.

The full API is the following:

```ocaml
type 'a expr
type 'a distribution

type ('s, 'i, 'o) muf_node =
    { init : 's;
      step : ('s * 'i -> 'o * 's); }

type ('s, 'i, 'o) instance =
    { state : 's;
      node : ('s, 'i, 'o) muf_node; }

val init : ('s, 'i, 'o) muf_node -> ('s, 'i, 'o) instance

val infer : int * ('s, 'i, 'o) muf_node -> ('s, 'i, 'o distribution) instance

val unfold : ('s, 'i, 'o) instance * 'i -> 'o * ('s, 'i, 'o) instance

val const : 'a -> 'a expr
val add : float expr * float expr -> float expr
val mult : float expr * float expr -> float expr
val app : ('a -> 'b) expr * 'a expr -> 'b expr
val pair : 'a expr * 'b expr -> ('a * 'b) expr
val array : 'a expr array -> 'a array expr
val lst : 'a expr list -> 'a list expr
val ite : bool expr -> 'a expr -> 'a expr -> 'a expr

val eval : 'a expr -> 'a

val sample : 'a distribution -> 'a expr
val observe : 'a distribution * 'a -> unit
```
